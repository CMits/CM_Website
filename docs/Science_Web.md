# ðŸ”— Project Pipeline: The Living Research Web

## 1. Concept Foundation
- **Vision**: Research as *living, executable apps* instead of static PDFs.  
- **Principles**: reproducibility, openness, permission control, collaboration.  
- **Stakeholders**: scientists, institutions, AI agents, industry partners.  

---

## 2. Core Infrastructure

### Research-as-Apps Framework
- Containerized code (e.g., Docker, Streamlit, Jupyter).  
- Metadata standards (author, DOI, license, dependencies).  
- APIs for app discovery and integration.  

### Permission & Licensing Layer
- Open / Restricted / Commercial modes.  
- Usage tracking dashboards.  
- Attribution & automatic citation mechanisms.  

---

## 3. Agent Integration
AI agents as collaborators:
- Search for relevant research-apps.  
- Request access to run methods.  
- Explore parameter spaces, generate variations.  
- Auto-acknowledge contributions.  

---

## 4. Researcher Workflow
1. Upload project â†’ becomes an interactive app.  
2. Other scientists or AI agents discover it.  
3. With permission, they run or extend it.  
4. Results are shared, with attribution.  
5. Iterative cycle â†’ *Living Research ecosystem*.  

---

## 5. Network Effect & Scaling
- Global research landscape maps built by AI.  
- Interdisciplinary pipelines assembled in real time.  
- **Metrics**: number of runs, extensions, collaborations formed.  

---

## 6. Impact & Culture Change
- **Faster science** â†’ no reimplementation bottleneck.  
- **More collaboration** â†’ across labs and disciplines.  
- **Measurable impact** â†’ transparent usage metrics.  
- **Cultural shift** â†’ science becomes alive, networked, and interactive.
