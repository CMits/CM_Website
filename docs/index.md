- 📚 [Articles](articles.md) — write-ups, protocols, notes

- 👤 [About me](about.md) — background & interests

- 🌍 Social Media:  
  - [YouTube](https://youtube.com/) 🎥

  - [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/) 💼  
  - [GitHub](https://github.com/) 💻  
  - [Email](mailto:youremail@example.com) ✉️  

- 📰 [Blog](blog/index.md) — science, self-development & sci-fi ideas
