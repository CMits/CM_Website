# About Me

I am Christos, an admirer of the miracle and magic of life. Science fascinates me because it seeks to unravel this miracle, from the tiniest scales of microbiology to the vastness of cosmology.

Currently, I am pursuing a PhD in computational biology at the ARC Centre of Excellence for Plant Success (UQ). My research focuses on cross-scale modeling, where I build molecular networks and integrate them with crop growth models to explore genotype × environment interactions.

**Interests**
- Cross-scale plant modeling (gene → phenotype → crop)
- Accessible tools for farmers (Streamlit apps, dashboards)
- VR for science communication & education
- AI in science
- Science fiction writing & ideas
- Cosmology
