# Projects

## PSoup â†” APSIM Integration
- Goal: connect gene-regulatory networks to crop phenotypes (tillers/TTN).
- Status: prototypes with Streamlit UI for exploration.
- Notes: scaling rules, binning logic, sensitivity, robustness.

## Sensitivity & Structural Analysis
- Experiments with Sobol indices, network perturbations, node importance.
- Tools: Python (SALib), R.

## VR for Plant Modeling
- Concept demos for teaching branching networks in 3D/VR.
- Goal: make models intuitive and enjoyable to learn.
