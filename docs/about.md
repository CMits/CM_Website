# About Me

I’m Chris, a PhD student at the ARC Centre of Excellence for Plant Success (UQ).  
My work focuses on **PSoup** (a gene network for shoot branching) and its integration with **APSIM** to explore genotype × environment effects.

**Interests**
- Cross-scale plant modeling (gene → phenotype → crop)
- Accessible tools for farmers (Streamlit apps, dashboards)
- VR for science communication & education
